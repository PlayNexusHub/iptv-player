PlayNexus IPTV Player – Setup Instructions
==========================================

Prerequisites
-------------
1. Windows 10+ (x64) with PowerShell 5+ or Windows Terminal.
2. Node.js 18+ and npm 10+ installed globally.
3. Git with access to PlayNexusHub/iptv-player (public).

Environment Preparation
-----------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/PlayNexusHub/iptv-player.git
   cd iptv-player
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and adjust values as needed (no secrets committed).
4. Update `config_template.json` into a tenant-specific `config.json` for deployment.

Development Workflow
--------------------
1. Start the Electron app in dev mode:
   npm start
2. Run lint/tests as needed (e.g., npm run test if added).
3. Keep CHANGELOG.txt and version.json up to date with every feature branch.

Secure Release Workflow
-----------------------
1. Bump the semantic version inside package.json + version.json.
2. Update CHANGELOG.txt and README/README_PlayNexus.txt with the new highlights.
3. Generate the release folder with obfuscated renderer:
   npm run release:prepare
   (outputs ./release/PlayNexus_IPTV_vX.Y.Z with docs + app.obf.js)
4. Build signed Windows artifacts:
   npm run build:secure
   (runs javascript-obfuscator then electron-builder --win)
5. Upload installer + release folder to GitHub under PlayNexusHub with a semantic tag (e.g., v1.1.0).
6. Never publish without README + README_PlayNexus + CHANGELOG + version.json present in the release folder.

Post-Release
------------
- Verify the release installer on a clean Windows VM.
- Archive the release folder plus installer in secure storage.
- Rotate any temporary credentials used during QA (no real secrets stored in repo).
